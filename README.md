This NEOS kernel/patch is now retired in favor of NEOS 20:

https://github.com/commaai/eon-neos

If your preferred fork isn't using NEOS 20 yet, work with the maintainer of that fork to have it updated.
If you absolutely must use the juice-me patched kernel alone, it can be checked out from the git history of this repo.
This option is strictly for advanced users with extremely specific requirements for older NEOS userlands.
